            <h3>Dale Willis - CEO</h3>
            <p>
                Dale was the chief architect of the Paradrop platform while working on his PhD in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
                As of 2015 he has chosen to leave the PhD program to pursue working on Paradrop full-time.
                Dale has experience working in academic research, in technical consulting, as well as the private sector, both for startups and established companies.
                He previously worked with Suman at the startup Harvest Power Technologies.
                Dale completed his Bachelors double major in Computer Engineering and Computer Science, as well as Masters in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

<h1 id='faq'>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <h3>What is Paradrop?</h3>
  <p>
    Paradrop is a research project out of the
      <a href='http://research.cs.wisc.edu/wings/doku.php'>WiNGS Laboratory</a>
    in the
      <a href='http://cs.wisc.edu'>Computer Sciences</a>
    department at
      <a href='http://wisc.edu'>The University of Wisconsin - Madison</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a framework that allows third party developers access to computational
    resources on access points (APs or gateways) within the home. Its goal is to
    bring networking intelligence in the home through the replacement of
    commodity WiFi AP hardware.
  </p>
  <p>
    This will provide many unique capabilities to all entities who come in
    contact with networking-related technology including:

    <ul>
      <li>end-users</li>
      <li>developers</li>
      <li>ISPs</li>
      <li>content distributors</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Where can I get a Paradrop Router?</h3>
  <p>
    We are currently perfecting out hardware platform, and so at this time we
    do not have a commercial product available.

    We have already released some prototypes and are moving forward with a
    main build idea. <a data-toggle="modal" data-target="#contactModal">Please join our interest list for more information.</a>

  <h3>Why name it Paradrop?</h3>
  <p>
    By definition, a paradrop is a deployment of supplies to a mobile or not
    well-travelled location.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is exactly what Paradrop does -- it provides supplies (computational
    resources) to developers in a location that is traditionally difficult to
    access, the home.
  </p>

  <h3>Why might I want computational resources in my home?</h3>
  <p>
    Paradrop enables the decoupling of the network control plane for many
    categories of applications in a way that isn't possible by other means.

    What this allows is a network-based approach to implement applications
    that are agnostic to the end points of a service.
