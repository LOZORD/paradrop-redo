                Paradrop provides an intelligent platform on the router, where special applications are installed by the owner.
                These apps enable your router, the nerve center of all Internet in the home, to solve complex problems in ways that are impossible using today's routers.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, parental controls are a breeze with Paradrop.
                Simply install a parental controls app and the Paradrop router will create a separate network for your children.
                You will no longer need to configure each device or worry if your child has friends over and they have uncontrolled devices.
                Because the router manages all access through a special network, you never have to worry about the content your children view on the Internet while in the home.

              <h3>Simplifying parental controls in the home.</h3>
              <p>
                After installing the app, a <em class='pdblue'>special network</em> is created just for your children.
                Now, <em>any</em> device that connects to this network will have its traffic reviewed by the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember, since this is a Paradrop app we can actually support much more complex abilities:
              </p>
              <p class='list-group'>
                What if you want your child to stop using Facebook(TM) after 2 hours on weekdays?
              </p>
              <p class='list-group'>
                What if you want to record content your young child sees so that if they do see something bad you can at least know what it was?
              </p>
              <p class='list-group'>
                What if your child has friends over and one of them has a tablet that doesn't have parental controls on it? 
              </p>
              <p>
                <em class='pdblue'>All of these problems are easily solved by Paradrop because it uses the router</em>

          <h3>Guaranteed Hi-Def streaming movies in the home.</h3>
          <p>
            For the lucky few having the ability to stream HD movies all the time in the home is a great thing.
            However for the vast majority of users, streaming true HD content 100% of the time is not possible.
            This was our target when creating the Netflix app.
          </p>
          <p>
            After installing the app, simply log in using your Netflix credentials, the app will parse the content of your Netflix account.
            You can choose to either download videos you know you will watch eventually, say for instance a movie tonight with the family.
            Or you can choose to download videos from you "list" or other suggestions that Netflix has for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next time you start watching Netflix using your router, the app simply provides the video instead of Netflix servers.
            This <em class='pdblue'>guarantees</em> that no matter how bad your Internet connection is, the video you watch will be full High-Definition.

          <h3>Cloud-based security without the cloud.</h3>
          <p>
            Security in the home is simpler today than it ever has been in the past.
            Dozens of options for cloud-based monitoring of your home exist.
            But what if you don't want your private video to be held in the cloud?
            Then the options drop down to nearly zero.
          </p>
          <p>
            After installing the Paradrop security camera app, your router becomes the new cloud for security cameras in your home.
            The video is stored locally, but still accessible from anywhere in the world using secure temporary connections to the home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the video is local, the app can also process the video to look for problems, unknown people, motion, or other settings could all be specified.
