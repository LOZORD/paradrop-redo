            For instance, parental controls are a breeze with Paradrop.
            Simply install a parental controls app from our app store and the Paradrop router will create a separate network for your children.
            You will no longer need to configure each device or worry if your child has friends over and they have uncontrolled devices.
            Because the router manages all access through a special network, you never have to worry about the content your children view on the Internet while in the home.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since the router controls all Internet traffic in the home, the possibilities for apps are endless.
            For an explanation of a few different apps, please see our <a href="#exampleapps">example applications</a> below.

                <h3>Cloud-based security without the cloud.</h3>
                <p>
                Security in the home is simpler today than it ever has been in the past.
                Dozens of options for cloud-based monitoring of your home exist.
                But what if you don't want your private video to be stored in the cloud where you have no control over the security of it?
                Then the options drop down to nearly zero.
                </p>
                <p>
                After installing the Paradrop security camera app, your router becomes the new cloud for security cameras in your home.
                The video is stored locally, but still accessible from anywhere in the world using secure temporary connections to the home.
                </p>
                <p>
                Since the video is local, the app can also process the video to look for problems such as:
                <h4><li>unknown people</li>
                <li>motion</li></h4>
